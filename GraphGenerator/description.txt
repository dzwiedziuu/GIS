Application which creates new graph for parametrized number of vertex and probability of creating edge between every two vertex.

Parameters:
	-v - number of vertex
	-p - probability of creating edge between every two vertex
	-od - directory where to store output graph
	-of - file where to store output graph
	-c - print output on console

Syntax:
application.jar -v NUMBER -p PROBABILITY [-od OUTPUT_PATH] [-of OUTPUT_FILE] [-c]

Typical usage:
application.jar -v 10 -p 0.2 -od "/home/user/temp_cat" -of "test_graph1.gra" -c

Command above creates graph with 10 vertex, with probability of creating edge between each other 0.2, saves it as file "/home/user/temp_cat/test_graph1.gra" and print output at console.
